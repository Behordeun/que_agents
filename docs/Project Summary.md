## ⚙️ Configuration Management

To enhance flexibility and maintainability, all critical system settings are now managed through dedicated YAML configuration files located in the `configs/` directory. This approach centralizes configuration, making it easier to adapt the system to different environments (development, staging, production) without modifying the core codebase.

### Configuration Files Overview

- **`configs/agent_config.yaml`**: Contains parameters specific to the AI agents, such as the language model names (`model_name`) and their creativity settings (`temperature`). This allows for fine-tuning agent behavior without code changes.

    ```yaml
    customer_support_agent:
      model_name: gpt-4-1106-preview
      temperature: 0.3

    marketing_agent:
      model_name: gpt-4-1106-preview
      temperature: 0.7
    ```

- **`configs/api_config.yaml`**: Defines settings for the FastAPI application, including network binding (host, port), debugging options (`reload`), logging level (`log_level`), API metadata (title, description, version), and documentation URLs. It also includes authentication details (`api_token`) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.

    ```yaml
    api:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 8000
      reload: true
      log_level: info
      title: Agentic AI API
      description: REST API for Customer Support and Marketing AI agents
      version: 1.0.0
      docs_url: /docs
      redoc_url: /redoc

    authentication:
      api_token: demo-token-123

    cors:
      allow_origins:
        - "*"
      allow_credentials: true
      allow_methods:
        - "*"
      allow_headers:
        - "*"
    ```

- **`configs/database_config.yaml`**: Specifies the connection parameters for the PostgreSQL database, such as the connection URL (`url`), whether to echo SQL statements (`echo`), and connection pooling settings (`pool_size`, `max_overflow`, `pool_timeout`, `pool_recycle`).

    ```yaml
    database:
      url: postgresql://agentic_user:agentic_pass@localhost/agentic_ai
      echo: false
      pool_size: 10
      max_overflow: 20
      pool_timeout: 30
      pool_recycle: 3600
    ```

- **`configs/knowledge_base_config.yaml`**: Configures the path for the SQLite database used by the `SimpleKnowledgeBase` for storing document metadata and full-text search indexes.

    ```yaml
    knowledge_base:
      db_path: knowledge_base.db
    ```

### Best Practices for Production

For production deployments, it is strongly recommended to implement a robust secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to handle sensitive information such as database credentials and API tokens. These should not be hardcoded directly in configuration files or environment variables in a production environment. The current YAML files are suitable for development and demonstration purposes.
