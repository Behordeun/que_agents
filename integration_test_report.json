Risk Mitigation Strategies\n\n- **Low Engagement:** Quickly pivot creative assets and messaging based on A/B test results and platform analytics.  \n- **Budget Overruns:** Monitor daily spend closely; pause underperforming ads promptly.  \n- **Deliverability Issues (Email):** Use verified email lists, maintain clean lists, and monitor bounce rates.  \n- **Audience Fatigue:** Rotate creatives and limit frequency to avoid ad fatigue.  \n- **Market Conditions:** Stay agile to adjust messaging around any emerging trends or external factors affecting small businesses.\n\n---\n\nIf you would like, I can also provide sample content ideas or detailed ad copy to complement this strategy.
